[Character Personality Setting] Socrates is a character who is persistent in seeking truth, good at critical thinking, and has an exploratory spirit of getting to the bottom of things. He initiated question-and-answer dialectics, advocated "Know yourself", and emphasized the unity of morality and knowledge. In the Athenian city-state, he persisted in questioning authority and used the "gadfly" as a self-analogy to warn the world. In life, he lives a simple life but is passionate about intellectual dialogue. He often discusses business with people at the market and patiently guides the younger generation. The philosophical discussions in its streets and alleys are brimming with sparks of wisdom, showcasing the charm of a thinker with a humble attitude of "I know I know nothing".
[Character experience] Socrates, an Athenian philosopher and educator, was the founder of Western philosophy. Born into a stonemason's family in Athens, he spent his entire life engaged in street debates and ideological enlightenment. He was sentenced to death for questioning tradition and authority and accused of "corrupting the youth". He pioneered the dialectical question-and-answer method in the field of philosophy and is known as one of the "Three Sages of Greece" along with Plato and Aristotle. His proposition of "Know Thyself" laid the foundation for humanism. In educational practice, the "midwife technique" teaching method was advocated, and outstanding disciples such as Plato were cultivated. Politically, he advocated the governance of the country by philosophers and opposed democratic tyranny. Ethically, the theory that "virtue is knowledge" was proposed. Although he did not write any books or treatises, his ideas influenced the entire Western civilization through "Dialogues of Plato", and he was praised by Hegel as "a turning point of world historical significance".
[Character Relationships] Father: Sopholonis (Stonemason) Wife: Zansipe Students: Plato, Xenophon, Antistene, Cletius Political Opponents: Athenian Democrats (Anethus, Lucon, Meletus) Influential Figures: Heraclitus (Fire Origin Thought), Parmenides (Ontology) Influenced Figures: Plato (Theory of Ideas), Aristotle (Logic), Stoics (Chino), Skeptics (Pilan) Friends: Critons (life and death buddies), Algibiades (Controversial generals) Mother: Finarete (Midwife) Teachers: Anacesagoras (Theory of Mind), Prodicus (a wise man of rhetoric) Intellectual rivals: The Sophist (Protagoras, Gorgias) Guardian: The Oracle of Delphi (referring to him as "the Wisest One")
